# Machine Learning Applications
A collection of real-world machine learning web applications built with ML.NET, ASP.NET Core, Azure Cosmos DB, and React. 

# Goal
The goal is to provide a starting point to build new machine learning applications or features. 

**Please feel free to use the repo to start your new application or add it to your existing application!**

# Getting Started - API
1. Download the Azure CosmosDB emulator in order to run the API project locally. Here is a download link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator-release-notes#download.
2. Start the emulator
3. Set the API project as your Startup project in Visual Studio
4. The swagger UI page should be loaded at: https://localhost:5001/swagger/index.html
